# AuthentiCity: Connecting Travellers with Genuine Local Experts

## Project Overview and Motivation

**AuthentiCity** is a community-driven digital platform designed to revolutionise the way travellers experience cities around the world. It is built on a single philosophy — the most authentic way to discover a city is through the eyes of someone who truly calls it home.

The global tourism landscape is currently saturated with **commercialised, repetitive, and impersonal tour experiences**. Many large tour operators prioritise profit over authenticity, leading to:

- Overcrowded landmark visits  
- Generic, non-customised itineraries  
- A loss of cultural and personal connection  

Travellers today crave something deeper: **genuine human connection**, local insight, and the chance to experience cities as locals do.

**AuthentiCity** bridges this gap by directly connecting travellers with **independent, passionate local guides**. These guides—often residents who simply love sharing their city’s hidden gems, culture, and stories—offer experiences that are personal, spontaneous, and true to the city’s soul.

Our mission is to **restore authenticity to travel** by fostering meaningful interactions between visitors and locals, using the power of **AI** and **community feedback** to curate trustworthy, human-centred travel experiences.

## Core Platform Features

AuthentiCity is designed around two key user groups — **Local Guides (Experts)** and **Travellers (Explorers)** — supported by a sophisticated **AI Matchmaking Engine** that intelligently connects the right people together.

### 1. For Local Tour Guides (The Experts)

Local residents can join as **volunteer guides or micro-entrepreneurs**, sharing their knowledge and stories in exchange for tips or self-defined fees.

#### Key Features

- **Volunteer Registration**  
  Individuals register as private guides. While the platform encourages a *tip-based* approach, each guide has complete autonomy to set a fixed price if desired.

- **Detailed “About Me” Profile**  
  Each guide builds a comprehensive profile including:
  - **Personal Background:** Their story, interests, and connection to the city.  
  - **Fields of Expertise:** Tags describing areas of focus (e.g. “Street Art,” “Local Cuisine,” “Hidden Cafés,” “Public Transport Adventures”).  
  - **Availability:** Up-to-date schedules showing when they are available for tours.  
  - **Unique Offerings:** Descriptions of personalised tour themes, e.g. “The forgotten corners of old Montréal” or “Mumbai’s midnight food trail.”

- **Autonomy and Flexibility**  
  Guides design their own itineraries, share personal anecdotes, and choose how they engage visitors. Every guide—and therefore every tour—is one-of-a-kind.

### 2. For Travellers (The Explorers)

Travellers use AuthentiCity to connect directly with passionate locals for truly customised experiences.

#### Key Features

- **City-Based Discovery**  
  Travellers start by selecting their destination city. They can browse guides or use the AI chatbot for personalised recommendations.

- **Manual and AI-Assisted Filtering**  
  Travellers can search based on:
  - Ratings and reviews  
  - Availability and schedule  
  - Interests and expertise tags  
  - Tour type (walking, food-based, storytelling, neighbourhood-specific, etc.)

- **Direct Private Connection**  
  Once a guide is selected, the platform enables direct chat to finalise logistics, pricing, and expectations. No middlemen, no commission-driven interference — just genuine connection.

### 3. AI Matchmaking (The Intelligent Connector)

The **AI Matchmaking System** is AuthentiCity’s key differentiator, using natural language understanding and context analysis to create **perfect traveller-guide pairings**.

#### AI Features

- **Conversational Interface**  
  Travellers interact with a chatbot powered by the **Gemini API**. They describe their preferences in plain language, e.g.:

  > “I’ll be in Barcelona for two days. I love art, but I also want to explore local markets. I’m free in the mornings.”

- **Smart Profile Analysis**  
  The AI analyses:
  - Guide bios, expertise tags, and past reviews  
  - Guide availability and location data  
  - Review sentiment (extracted using AI review analysis)

- **Best-Fit Recommendation**  
  Based on these variables, the AI suggests guides whose profiles most closely align with the traveller’s tone, goals, and constraints. This makes every connection intentional and high quality.

## Community and Review System (AI-Driven Feedback Loop)

A cornerstone of AuthentiCity’s success lies in its **community-based feedback and improvement system**.

### Post-Tour Review Form
After every tour, travellers are prompted to fill out a short form evaluating their experience. This review includes:
- Ratings (overall satisfaction, knowledge, communication)
- Short written feedback
- Optional photo uploads

### AI Review Analysis
These reviews are not just stored — they are **analysed by AI** to extract actionable insights:
- **Sentiment categorisation** (e.g., “friendly,” “insightful,” “funny,” “knowledgeable”)
- **Keyword clustering** for guide traits and city-specific trends
- **Data aggregation** for transparency and matchmaking improvement

This allows the system to dynamically learn which guides are consistently excelling and what experiences travellers value most.

### Impact
- Guides receive detailed, AI-generated summaries of their strengths and improvement areas.  
- Tourists gain confidence through data-driven reputation scoring.  
- The platform continuously evolves based on **collective community knowledge**.

## Economic Model: Fair, Transparent, and Community-Oriented

- **Tip-Based Economy:**  
  AuthentiCity promotes a voluntary, tip-based payment culture to keep experiences accessible. However, guides can choose to set a **fixed price** for tours if they wish.

- **No Platform Commissions (Phase 1):**  
  In early development, AuthentiCity will not take commissions to encourage organic community growth and trust.

- **Future Revenue Streams:**  
  - Premium guide verification badges  
  - AI-powered itinerary planning for travellers  
  - Local business collaborations (sustainable cafés, artists, markets)
